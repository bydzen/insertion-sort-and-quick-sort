## Getting Started

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.

### Prerequisites

Should at least be able to understand one of the C, C ++, or C # programming languages. and little knowledge about data structures to understand this project

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

### Installing

Code::Blocks is a program that is suitable for us in making this project. With the application console, we can handle this project well.

Installing Code::Blocks, can be installed using the following steps.

```
Windows: http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/32bit/codeblocks-20.03mingw-32bit-setup.exe
```

Installing Code::Blocks for Linux user (tested in Debian)

```
user@linux:~$ sudo apt install codeblocks
```

End, and wait until the installation process is complete.

## Running the tests

To open this project, simply clone to the directory folder, open the Code::Blocks software then go to file navigation and open the file. Navigate to the cloned directory and open it with a file extension (.cbp) to open the entire project.

#### Break down into end to end tests

Simply search for Compile & Run navigation to run the program.

For Linux users can create a build program to get files with the extension (.o) so that it can run. 

```
user@linux:~$ sudo gcc -o namefile.c
```

Execute the namefile.

```
user@debian$ sudo ./namefile
```
### And coding style tests

The test program has been run successfully and the overall functionality works well. For Windows you can open the settings and compiler, toolchain executable.

For Linux, test this to check that gcc is installed correctly or not.

```
user@debian$ sudo gcc
```


## Deployment Functionality

- [x] Input size (n). ```how much 'n'``` to do a sorting.
